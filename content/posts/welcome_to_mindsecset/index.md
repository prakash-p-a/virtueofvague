MindSecSet is where I document my ongoing career in cybersecurity: the wins, the hard lessons, the "aha" moments of unlearning outdated approaches and relearning better ones.

I will start posting initially about cybersecurity basics and we will gradually reach current trends as well along with time.

This field demands constant adaptation where new threats emerge daily, tools evolve, and what worked yesterday might fail tomorrow.

These posts are honest reflections from someone in the trenches, shared to help make your own advancement feel more achievable.

No gatekeeping—just real talk.
Thanks for joining the journey.
