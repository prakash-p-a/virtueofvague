This space is my quiet corner of the internet, a place to embrace the beauty in vagueness and the clarity in knowing better.


Know the Better is the personal side:
Reflections on emotions, spirituality, growth, and the subtle mysteries of life.

Most of us walk similar paths:
facing uncertainty, seeking meaning, healing old wounds, and discovering quiet moments of clarity.

These writings come from my own journey through the vague and undefined spaces of being human.

If you're here, you're probably feeling some of the same things.

My hope is that these words remind you you're not alone, and perhaps make the road feel a little lighter, a little more familiar.

We’re all figuring it out together.
Here I share my inner journey, moments of doubt, wonder, and quiet insight.


MindSecSet is the personal side:

Sharing my career journey in cybersecurity and technology.

Along the way, I've learned, unlearned, and relearned countless lessons.

About tools, threats, best practices, mindset shifts, and what truly drives professional growth in this fast-evolving field.

I will start posting initially about cybersecurity basics and we will gradually reach current trends as well along with time.

These writings are raw reflections on building expertise, overcoming setbacks, and staying ahead.

If you're on a similar path whether starting out, pivoting, or leveling up.
I hope these insights make your journey a little clearer, more confident, and less isolating.

We're all securing our own paths, one lesson at a time.


This isn't about having all the answers. 
It's about asking better questions, staying curious, and growing one vague step at a time.

Thanks for being here. Feel free to subscribe or reach out.
