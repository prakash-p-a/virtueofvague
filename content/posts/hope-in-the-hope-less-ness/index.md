Hope is that quiet force giving us a reason to live,

to laugh,

to love,

to stay happy, even when everything feels heavy.



For a beggar, hope is the key to facing another day.

For a patient, it's the strength to hold on for tomorrow.



One of my favorite stories about hope:

All the villagers gathered to pray for rain after a long drought. Everyone came empty-handed... except one boy who brought an umbrella.



That's hope.



In this chaotic world, we long for normal days as past and those simple smiles, ordinary routines, a life like before.



Yet it's this very hope that keeps us moving forward.



In hopelessness, hope is the light we carry inside.



— Prakash Ayyanagoudar
