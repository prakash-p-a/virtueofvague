We often think our struggles, questions, and quiet longings are ours alone.

But the more I open up about my own doubt, wonder, grief, hope, and the suffering of spirituality the more I realize how much we share.

This space is for those in-between moments: the emotions we can't quite name, the spiritual stirrings that don't fit neat boxes, the slow, messy growth that happens in silence.

If you're here, chances are you're walking a similar path.
I write these reflections not because I have answers, but because I've lived the questions may times and sometimes, knowing someone else has felt the same can make the journey feel less heavy.

You're not alone in the vague.

Thank you for being here.
