Happiness.

For decades, we've chased it like something lost, something to discover out there in the world.

But true happiness isn't found. It's built.
And it can only be built by us especially from within.

We can't force it by constantly thinking about it.
Instead, we stay happy by choosing a lifestyle of happiness:
That is quietly eliminating toxic thoughts that create toxic realities.

When we let go of negativity, space opens for peace.

As the Buddha beautifully said:

Move your thoughts from competition to contribution then your life becomes a celebration.

A small shift in perspective can change everything.

What toxic thought will you release today?
